# jazz_groovebox
junkbox for a jazz groovebox
Creating a Python code for a jazz groove box with the features you've described is quite an advanced task, but I can certainly help you get started with a basic structure. Here's a conceptual outline of how you might approach this project:

```python
import os
import hashlib

# Function to generate a hash of a rhythm pattern
def hash_pattern(pattern):
    return hashlib.sha256(pattern.encode()).hexdigest()

# Function to perform binary search on sorted list of rhythms
def binary_search(arr, low, high, x):
    if high >= low:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x)
        else:
            return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x)
    else:
        return -1

# Load rhythm patterns from files
def load_patterns(directory):
    patterns = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith('.rhythm'):
            with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'r') as file:
                patterns[filename] = file.read()
    return patterns

# Find similar grooves using feature hashing
def find_similar_grooves(patterns, target_hash):
    similar = []
    for name, pattern in patterns.items():
        pattern_hash = hash_pattern(pattern)
        if pattern_hash == target_hash:
            similar.append(name)
    return similar

# Visual rhythm file selector (pseudo-code)
def select_rhythm_file():
    # This would be a GUI element allowing the user to select a rhythm file
    pass

# Main function to tie it all together
def main():
    directory = 'path_to_rhythm_files'
    patterns = load_patterns(directory)
    selected_file = select_rhythm_file()
    target_hash = hash_pattern(patterns[selected_file])
    
    # Assuming the patterns are sorted by some criteria
    sorted_patterns = sorted(patterns.keys())
    bridge_index = binary_search(sorted_patterns, 0, len(sorted_patterns)-1, target_hash)
    
    if bridge_index != -1:
        print(f"Bridge rhythm found at index {bridge_index}")
        similar_grooves = find_similar_grooves(patterns, target_hash)
        print(f"Similar grooves: {similar_grooves}")
    else:
        print("No bridge rhythm found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this is a simplified version and does not include the actual implementation of a rhythm music theory model or a GUI for file selection. Also, the binary search algorithm requires a sorted list of rhythms, which means you'll need to define the criteria for sorting your rhythm patterns. The feature hashing function provided is a basic example of how you might compare rhythms.

For a complete implementation, you would need to develop the rhythm music theory model, create a GUI for selecting rhythm files, and refine the feature hashing to effectively find similar grooves. You might also want to consider using a machine learning model to analyze and classify rhythm patterns for more advanced similarity matching.
